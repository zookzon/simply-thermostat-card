# Simply Thermostat Card (Compat)

A modern and minimal **Lovelace thermostat card** for Home Assistant.

## Features
- Chip Header color-coded by hvac_mode
- Cooling animation
- Temperature +/âˆ’ controls
- Toggleable rows (mode, fan, swing, preset)
- Chip toggle bar for hidden rows

This is the **compat build** (no import of 'lit') so it works on more HA versions.
